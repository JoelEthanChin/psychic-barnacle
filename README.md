The only barnacle that can see into the future

The contents of this repository include my verilog code 
used to simulate a Tug-O-War game on a Spartan 3 
FPGA. There are various other files not related to the TOW
game here because I want to keep my verilog code together.
If you have a problem with that, you don't have to use
anything from my repository.
